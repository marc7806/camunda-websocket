# Camunda Websockets Example
## Example Use-Case
### Travelling Process
In this example we are a travel booking company with following requirements:
- Users can book a new travel (this starts a new instance of the travel-booking-process)
- We have an administration Web-UI where we can see in realtime, as soon as a new travel gets booked (with the help of websockets)
